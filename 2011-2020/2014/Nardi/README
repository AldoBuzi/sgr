First start CommandRedisAnalizer that shows the presence of read that not contains Redis command,
then start the RedisQueriesStat that shows the stats of all the upperCase strings command.

1) Is ok get the redis-server read to parse the command?
2) Is ok recognize a command based on the presence or not of lowercase characters?
3) Should I add more functionality?
